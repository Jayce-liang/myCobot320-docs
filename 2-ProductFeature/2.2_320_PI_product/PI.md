**myCobot 320 Pi** belongs to myCobot 320 series and adopts a Raspberry Pi microprocessor. Its body weights 3kg with a load of 1kg and a working radius of 320 mm. The small-sized product is endowed with powerful functions. It is characterized by easy operation, ability to work with human safely and features three advantages of usability, safety and economy, making it a cost-effective product.

## 2  Features

* **Embedded Raspberry Pi Ecology Providing Unlimited Possibilities**

  -   Raspberry Pi 4B, 1.5GHz quad-core microprocessor, running with Debian/Ubuntu platform.

  -   Supports 4-way USB, 2-way HDMI, standardized GPIO interface, and a pluggable TF card.

-   **Unique Industrial Design**
    -   With all-in-one design, the product has a compact structure, and the net weight is only 3kg.
    -   With a modular design, the product is characterized by less spare parts, low maintenance cost, quick disassembly and replacement.

-   **Easy Operation and Open-Source**
    -   The users can operate the product in a short time through drag teaching.
    -   It supports ROS/moveIt and other development systems.

-   **High-Level Configuration and Powerful Performance**
    -   Since a brushless DC servo is applied, a repeated positioning precision of ±0.5mm can be reached.
    -   Being equipped with installation interfaces, the base and end are suitable for the development of various periphery devices.

-   **Economical and Cost-Effective**
    -   Worth over 10,000 RMB, it reduces costs and synergizes efforts for high-efficiency scientific research.

-   **Integrated Design and Safe Collaborative Work**
    -   With delicate structure, it optimizes space and integrates with application in a coordinated way.
    -   It also has kinematics self-interference detection, which can effectively avoid motion collisions.

## 3  Application

Like myCobot 320 M5, myCobot 320 Pi is not only a productivity tool but also an expanding tool for imagination boundary. It can work with multiple types of end effectors to adapt to a variety of application, such as scientific research, education and function showing, etc. The user experience is excellent.
